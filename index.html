      <p>This article is the first in a possible series going deep into the theory behind Steely Dan’s music. I have chosen to start with “Babylon Sisters” as it is both one of Becker and Fagen’s most complex tunes and one of their most popular - I was interested in finding out how a 44-chord tune can work as a piece of pop music. From here, I am considering working through the rest of Gaucho and possibly beyond.</p>

      <p>If you haven’t seen it already, I would recommend watching Donald Fagen’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR6OsrzbHHY&ab_channel=TheDanVault">Concepts For Jazz-Rock Piano</a>. In the video, he explains how he and Walter Becker developed their songs from common blues ideas. This article will attempt to follow a similar train of thought for Babylon Sisters. As you can see from the video, Fagen has a strong theoretical understanding of Steely Dan’s music and is able to talk through his musical choices using the common vocabulary of jazz and blues harmony. I am not claiming that this interpretation was Becker and Fagen’s intention when they wrote the tune and it is highly likely certain ideas just “sounded good”.</p>

      <p>A warning: this article will be a fairly dry discussion of theory underpinning this tune. It includes a general overview of the composition, before getting into a line-by-line analysis of the music. It assumes some knowledge of music theory, including <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_harmony">jazz</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues#Form">blues</a> theory. Where possible, I have included a link explaining theoretical concepts as they arise. The song has been transcribed in standard notation and includes a lead line that covers either the vocal or instrumental topline melody and a reduction of the piano and bass part. I have included chord symbols and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral_analysis#Jazz_and_pop_numerals">jazz/pop Roman numerals</a> explaining the function of each chord.</p>

      <h3>Keys</h3>

      <p>Babylon Sisters is built on four interrelated <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)">key centers</a>. Almost all of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatonic_scale">melodic</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonization">harmonic</a> material in the tune is derived from these keys:
      </p>

      <h4>Bb major</h4>
      <div class="example" id="osmd-ExBbMajor"></div>
      <h4>Bb minor (the parallel minor of Bb)</h4>
      <div class="example" id="osmd-ExBbMinor"></div>
      <h4>Db major (the relative major of Bb minor)</h4>
      <div class="example" id="osmd-ExDbMajor"></div>
      <h4>Db minor (the parallel minor of Db minor)</h4>
      <div class="example" id="osmd-ExDbMinor"></div>

      <p>The tonal unity of the song comes from <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borrowed_chord">modal interchange</a>, where notes and chords are borrowed from a parallel mode sharing the same tonic - in this case, Bb major-Bb minor and Db major-Db minor. The most common modal interchange in popular music is usually major-minor, although it could be any mode. There is also a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_key">relative</a> major-minor relationship between Db major and Bb minor, tying the four keys together.</p>
      
      <p>There is a connection between major-minor modal interchange and the blues, where “<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_note">blue notes</a>” (minor thirds and sevenths, flattened fifths) are introduced into an otherwise major tonality. Jazz musicians have exploited this blues connection by chosing standards that use this kind of modal interchange. For example, “On Green Dolphin Street” is built on the keys C major, C minor, Eb major and Eb minor - keys with the same relationship as those in Babylon Sisters.</p>
  
      <p>The introduction and bridges are in Db major and include a fairly straightforward modal mixture with Db minor. The introduction has a particularly “bluesy” sound as it shifts from major to minor.</p>

      <p>The verse has a more complex modal interchange around the Bb tonic. The verse starts on a Bbm chord, the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_key">relative minor</a> of the previous key, Db major. As the verse progresses, there is a transition in the melody from Bb minor to Bb major through the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(music)#Modern_modes">modes of the diatonic scale</a> - starting with Bb Aeolian, then Bb Dorian, Bb Mixolydian and Bb Ionian. The first mode, Aeolian, is the natural minor scale and each successive mode adds more notes from the major scale until arriving at the Ionian mode, the major scale itself.</p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <p><strong>Bb Aeolian (from Db Major)</strong></p>
            <div class="example" id="osmd-ExBbAeolian"></div>
          </td>
          <td>
            <p><strong>Bb Dorian (from Ab Major)</strong></p>
            <div class="example" id="osmd-ExBbDorian"></div>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <p><strong>Bb Mixolydian (from Eb Major)</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Bb Ionian (from Bb Major)</strong></p>
            <div class="example" id="osmd-ExBbIoanian"></div>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <blockquote>
        <em>Aeolian Mode:</em></br>
        “Drive West on Sunset to the sea,</br>
        Turn that jungle music down, just until we’re out of town.”</br>
        </br>
        <em>Dorian Mode:</em></br>
        “This is no one night stand, it’s a real occasion.”</br>
        </br>
        <em>Mixolydian Mode:</em></br>
        “Close your eyes and you’ll be there, it’s everything they say,”</br>
        </br>
        <em>Ionian Mode:</em></br>
        “The end of a perfect day, distant lights from across the bay.”
      </blockquote>

      <p>Each of these modes comes from a successive clockwise step on the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_fifths">circle of fifths</a>, with Bb Aeolian coming from the sixth degree of Db major, Bb Dorian coming from the second degree of Ab major, Bb Mixolydian coming from the fifth degree of Eb major and Bb Ionian coming from the first degree of Bb major. The successive keys on the circle of fifths are perceived to be “darker” moving anti-clockwise and “brighter” moving clockwise, so this verse progression can be perceived as getting “brighter”.</p>

      <p>The chorus stays in Bb major, reinforcing this as the overall “home” key of the tune.</p>
      
      <aside>
        <h3>A note on transcription</h3>
        <p>These keys represent particular challenges for transcription, as do their enharmonic equivalents - A# major, A# minor, C# major and C# minor. There is no way of transcribing this tune without introducing some double sharps or flats along the way. As this is an analysis, I want to show where the chords in the tune come from and how they relate to the home key, so there are going to be some Cb and Fb chords when the chords are derived from Db minor. For the sake of clarity, however, I have named chords built from the sixth degree of Db minor, Bbb, using A natural as the root. For example the Bbb9b5 in the intro is named A9b5. In concert, the song is usually played in A major, which would have been a lot easier to transcribe!</p>
      </aside>

      <h3>Backdoor-Mediant Turnaround</h3>

      <p>There are several unusual <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnaround_(music)">turnarounds</a> in the tune that warrant a separate discussion.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Introduction</strong> Fb–A9b5–Ebm7</li>
        <li><strong>Bridge</strong> Fb6/9–A13b5–Ebm7</li>
        <li><strong>Coda</strong> Eb–Ab7b5–Dm7</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In each of these instances, there is a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_progression">backdoor turnaround</a> targeting a tonic or <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonicization">tonicized</a> chord (IV–bVII–I). However, the tonicized chord has been <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_substitution">subsituted</a> with its mediant, a common substitute for the tonic. In the first and second instance, the Fb–A7b5 turnaround is targeting Cb, but it resolves to the mediant of Cb, Ebm7. In the third instance, the Eb–Ab7b5 turnaround is targeting Bb, but it resolves to the mediant of Bb, Dm7.</p>

      <p>This is how the Bb backdoor-mediant turnaround can be derived by changing a few notes in a common <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ii%E2%80%93V%E2%80%93I_progression">ii–V–I</a> turnaround:</p>

      <div class="example" id="osmd-ExBackdoorMediantBb"></div>

      <ul>
        <li>IV6 - The root of the ii chord, Cm7, is moved up a minor third to make an Eb6 chord. </li>
        <li>bVII7 - The root of the V chord, F9, is also raised a minor third and the G is flattened making an Ab7 chord. In all the examples above, the fifth is also flattened.</li>
        <li>iii7 - The root of the Bbmaj9 is moved up a major third, making the chord a Dm7.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>From here extensions can be added or removed, or further alterations can be made (e.g. removing the 6th from the IV6 chord or adding the ninth). Given the novel nature of this turnaround, I will refer to it as the “backdoor-mediant turnaround” whenever it occurs.</p>

      <h3>Rhythm and Arrangement</h3>

      <p>The song is in cut time or 2/2 and has a tempo of around 60bpm. It is built on the “Purdie Shuffle” beat, previously introduced on “Home At Last” from <em>Aja</em>. There are also multiple references to reggae and Jamaican culture in the music and lyrics, including a “skank” guitar pattern in the verses, off beat phrasing in the melody and bassline (“Drive west on…”, “Babylon…”) and the use of the word “Babylon” (presumably the Rastafari word for the Western world, not the ancient civilisation). There are several passages where the harmony is extremely sparse. These sections are sonically reminiscent of dub reggae, where harmony is stripped back, putting the emphasis on the bass and drums.</p>

      <h2 id="part-two">
        <div class="pre-heading">Part Two</div>
        <div class="heading">Lyrical Overview</div>
      </h2>

      <p>I don’t want to get too much into the analysis of the lyrics. Like most Steely Dan songs, there are some clear narrative aspects to the lyric and some cryptic elements that are left up to the listener to interpret. What is clear from the lyric is that the narrator is traveling in a car for an encounter which, although desirable, has led to dire warnings from his friends. Throughout the tune, the narrator flips between the positives and negatives of this encounter, just as the music flips between minor and major. In small doses, major/minor modal interchange can sound wistful or romantic. However, spread over longer passages it can reflect the confusion (or even delusion) of the narrator. This is something Becker and Fagen exploit here and the musical choices reflect the tone of the lyric.</p>

      <p>As previously discussed, the shift in tone from dark to bright in the music is reflected in the lyrics. In the first eight bars, in a minor tonality, the narrator seems irritable and paranoid:</p>

      <blockquote>
        “Drive West on Sunset to the sea,</br>
        Turn that jungle music down, just until we’re out of town.”
      </blockquote>

      <p>As the musical content of the verse brightens by shifting towards a major tonality, so does the narrator’s attitude towards the encounter:</p>

      <blockquote>
        “This is no one night stand, it’s a real occasion.</br>
        Close your eyes and you’ll be there, it’s everything they say,</br>
        The end of a perfect day, distant lights from across the bay.”
      </blockquote>

      <p>This is flipped in the second verse. Over the darker tonality, the narrator expresses his excitement about this encounter, while over the brighter tonality the narrator acknowledges that the encounter is a bad idea. This is an inventive way of reflecting the ambivalence of the narrator in the music.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <em>Aeolian Mode:</em><br>
        “We'll jog with show folk on the sand,<br>
        Drink kirschwasser from a shell, San Francisco show and tell.”<br>
        <br>
        <em>Dorian Mode:</em><br>
        “Well I should know by now that it's just a spasm.<br>
        <br>
        <em>Mixolydian Mode:</em><br>
        Like a Sunday in T.J. that it's cheap but it's not free,<br>
        <br>
        <em>Ionian Mode:</em><br>
        That I'm not what I used to be and that love's not a game for three.”
      </blockquote>

      <p>By the third verse, there is no part dealing with the positives of the encounter. A solo takes the place of the vocal over the darker part, while over the brighter second half, the lyric states in unequivocal terms what a bad idea it is:</p>

      <blockquote>
        “My friends say, ‘No don't go for that cotton candy<br>
        Son you're playing with fire, the kid will live and learn<br>
        As he watches his bridges burn from the point of no return.’”
      </blockquote>

      <p>The song begins with an extended 23 bar introduction in Db. It reuses some musical material from the chorus and bridge, but is largely unrelated to the rest of the tune. Notably the tonic Db chord doesn't appear and all of the phrases resolve to an Ebm7 chord, suggesting an Eb Dorian modality.</p>
        
      <p>Given the groups’s reputation for rich chord voicings, it is noticeable how sparse the harmony is in this section. Most of the chords are mostly voiced as fifth (Root-Five) chords - any additional harmonic information in this section has to be inferred from topline melody.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <div id="osmd-BSIntro1"></div>
      </div>

      <p>The first four bars move through a Gb5–Cb5–Ab5 progression (IV–bVII–V). There is the first hint of the Db minor tonality in the borrowed Cb5 chord, establishing a “bluesy” sound early in the piece. IV–bVII seems to be setting up a backdoor progression to I, which is interrupted by the shift down a minor third to the V chord instead. A melodic theme in Db major is played on the electric piano.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <div id="osmd-BSIntro2"></div>
      </div>

      <p>The Ab5 leads to another unexpected chord, an Fb (bIII) chord borrowed from Db minor. This shifts back to another Ab5 before resolving down a fourth to an Ebm7 (ii7). Over this section a lick in Db minor is played, introducing a blues sound to the topline melody. The final chord, Ebm7, appears as a figure consisting of two alternating chords - an Ebm7 and a Ebsus4.</p>
        
      <p>In this section there are several instances where a resolution to the tonic is expected but never occurs, giving this whole section a restless feeling. The Ab5–Ebm7 resolution at the end is similar to the iv-i found in minor <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-bar_blues">blues progressions</a> and reinforces the “bluesy” sound of this passage.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <div id="osmd-BSIntro3"></div>
      </div>

      <p>The next four bars are a variation on the opening theme, over a Gb5–Cb5–Ab5–Cb5 progression (IV–bVII–V–bVII). Once again a dominant chord appears without a clear resolution to a tonic, instead shifting back to a bVII (Cb5).</p>

      <div class="example">
        <div id="osmd-BSIntro4"></div>
      </div>

      <p>This leads to the introduction the “Shake It” theme. It is formed from a major triad, followed by dominant seventh in the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_inversion">third inversion</a> a whole tone above. In this case it appears as an Fb (bIII) followed by Gb/Fb (IV7). This theme will appear later in the tune in different keys and built on different degrees of the scale.  The Fb pedal point leads into the backdoor-mediant turnaround, resolving back to the Ebm7 figure. Apart from the Ab5 chord, the root movement in this section - Gb–Cb–Fb–A - moves clockwise around the circle of fifths, with a functional resolution to Ebm7 at the end. In comparison to the opening section, the harmony is becoming more functional as the tune heads towards the verse.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <div id="osmd-BSIntro5"></div>
      </div>

      <p>This section repeats and, on the second repetition, the recurring Ebm7 figure resolves down to Bbm, shifting its function from the ii7 of Db to the iv7 of Bb. This creates another iv7-i motion into the verse.</p>

      <p>The verse follows an irregular 19 bar form. As previously outlined, it modulates from Bb minor to Bb major via the successive modes of the diatonic scale.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <div id="osmd-BSVerseOne1"></div>
      </div>

      <p>The verse starts with a Bbm7–Cm7– Eb9–Eb13 (i7–ii7–IV7) progression. The Bbm7–Cm7–Eb progression is a recurring theme in the verse, with the Eb chord varying each time. A Bb minor triad is outlined in the melody over the Bbm7 chord and seems to establish a natural minor tonality. However, this is undermined by the Cm7, Eb9 and Eb13 chords, which all contain a G♮. Eb9 and Eb13, functioning as a single IV7 chord, acts as a secondary dominant to the first chord of the next section, Ab/Db.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <div id="osmd-BSVerseOne2"></div>
      </div>

      <p>The next section starts with a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_chord">slash</a> chord, Ab/Db. The preceding Eb13 chord resolves to the Ab triad in the upper structure, however the Db in the bass makes this chord a Dbmaj7sus2, (bIIIsus). The remainder of the chords in this section are diatonic to Bb minor or Aeolian, as is the melody. The descending Ab13–Gbmaj13 progression seems to be resolving to Db, but instead resolves to a Bbm7 chord in the last bar.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <div id="osmd-BSVerseOne3"></div>
      </div>

      <p>The next section starts with another Bbm7–Cm7–Eb progression, again with a Bbm triad outlining the Bbm7 chord. However, this phrase rises to a G♮ over the Cm7 chord, moving the melody into a Bb Dorian modality. The next bar contains the kind of passing chord that defies easy classification. It is a cluster chord with C, Eb, F and G in the upper structure and D in the bass. Given the recurrence of an Eb chord in this third bar, it could be viewed as a Ebmaj13 chord in the third inversion, Ebmaj13/D (IV∆). The melody over this chord also outlines the first three notes of the Eb major scale. The chord doesn't serve a particular function, and it resolves back to Bbm7 again in the last bar.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <div id="osmd-BSVerseOne4"></div>
      </div>

      <p>The next section starts with another Bbm7–Cm7–Eb progression. This time the Eb chord is an Eb/F (V7sus) resolving to the tonic, Bbmaj9 (i7–ii7–V7sus–I∆). There is a sense of resolution when the major tonic chord lands, and this progression beings a series of functional harmonic changes heading towards the chorus. The melody over this section contains an Ab and D♮, placing it in a Bb Mixolydian modality.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <div id="osmd-BSVerseOne5"></div>
      </div>

      <p>The verse concludes with a E7b5–Ebmaj13–A7#9#5 progression. The E7b5 is a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritone_substitution">tritone substitute</a> for Bb7, the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_chord">secondary dominant</a> to the Ebmaj13 (bII/IV–IV∆). The final chord is an A7#9#5 chord, acting as a secondary dominant to Dm7, the first chord of the chorus (V7alt/iii–iiim7). Although this change might seem jarring, the A7#9#5 is a tritone substitute for Eb13b5 so the voice leading in the upper structure is smooth. The melody in this section now contains an A♮, completing the shift to Bb Ionian or major.</p>

      <p>The chorus consists of a sixteen bar section that follows an AABA structure. This is followed by a two bar key change into the bridge. The chorus is mostly diatonic to the key of Bb major, with some secondary dominants and borrowed chords from Bb minor.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <div id="osmd-BSChorusOne1"></div>
      </div>

      <p>The A section starts on the iii chord, Dm7. After the relatively full chord voicings of the verse, the chorus returns to the sparse arrangement of the introduction. The bass, piano and vocal outline the word “Babylon” in unison, before filling out the full Dm7 chord on the word “sisters”. In the third bar there is another instance of the “Shake It” line, this time appearing as a Eb–F7/Eb pair (IV–V). This A section repeats.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <div id="osmd-BSChorusOne2"></div>
      </div>

      <p>The harmony fills out again in the B section. The progression is C9–F9–Bbmaj7 (V7/V–V7–I∆7), where C9 is a secondary dominant to F9. The Bbmaj7 chord switches to Bbm7 in the fourth bar, becoming a pre-dominant chord to the Eb9, a secondary dominant leading back to Dm7, the iii7. The melody over this section exploits the chromatic differences between chords (E♮ in C9 to Eb in F9, D♮ in Bbmaj7 to Db in Bbm7). In both these cases, the flattened notes are from the Bb <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_scale">blues scale</a>.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <div id="osmd-BSChorusOne3"></div>
      </div>

      <p>The next four bars are an instrumental variation of the A section. A C9 is added in the second bar, which functions as a secondary dominant to the F/Eb chord.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <div id="osmd-BSChorusOne4"></div>
      </div>

      <p>The transition from the chorus to the bridge is one of the more harmonically complex parts of the tune. The progression is Cb/Fb–Gb/Fb–Db/Gb–Ab/Gb–Bb7b9. The first bar of the bridge starts with an Ebm7 chord, so the Bb7b9 is a secondary dominant to that chord. The chords leading up to the Bb7b9 can be viewed as a backdoor progression leading to the tonic chord (bVI–bVII–I). The bVI chord, Gb7/Fb, is preceded by Cb/Fb, which is behaving like a suspension of the Gb7/Fb chord (bVI7sus–bVI7). The bVII chord, Ab7/Gb, is preceded by a similar chord, Db/Gb, also behaving like a suspension of Ab7/Gb (bVII7sus–bVII7). This resolves to the tonic, Bb7b9, which is in the form of a dominant chord. Despite the unusual chords in this section, there is a strong sense of harmonic resolution leading into the bridge.</p>

      <p>The first chorus is followed by a bridge, consisting of a four bar vocal section, followed by an five bar instrumental leading back to the verse. Like the introduction it is in Db major with a modal interchange to Db minor, and resolves to an Ebm7 chord, giving the section an Eb Dorian flavour.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <div id="osmd-BSBridgeOne1"></div>
      </div>

      <p>The bridge starts on an Ebm chord, which resolves down to the tonic, a Db6 chord (ii7–I6). This is followed by Cbmaj7 and Cb7 in the third bar, with Cbmaj7 acting as a passing chord to Cb7, the bVII in Db minor. The Cb7 resolves to Fb6/9-A7b5, a backdoor-mediant turnaround resolving to Ebm7 in the next bar. Over this section the melody, harmonized in triads, is diatonic to Db major.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <div id="osmd-BSBridgeOne2"></div>
      </div>

      <p>The next section only appears once. Heading back to the key of Bb for verse, the chords cycle through different variations of Ebm7 (the ii7 chord) and Bb7 (the V7/ii chord) - Db/Eb–Ab/Bb–Ebm7–Bb7b9–Ebm7b5–Bbm7. The root moves back and forth between Eb and Bb. In the upper structure, there is a chain of resolutions going down by fourths - Db–Ab–Ebm7–Bb7b9. The Ebm7b5, the borrowed from Db minor, resolves back to a Bbm7 chord leading back into verse, shifting its function from iiø7 to the ivø7 of Bb.</p>

      <p>The second bridge follows the first melodically. However, instead of the backdoor-mediant resolution in the last bar, the A13b5 is replaced with an F7, resolving straight back to Bbm7 for the start of the solo. The A13b5 shares some common tones with F7 (A and Eb) but the function here is different.</p>

      <p>The trumpet solo, played by Randy Brecker, falls over the first part of the verse changes and uses the Bb minor scale. The vocal enters with a truncated verse in the second half of the form, following the same melodic and harmonic structure as before. The third and final chorus is the same as the other choruses. However, instead of the transition into the bridge the tune moves straight into the coda.</p>

      <p>The coda is a repeated variation on the A section of the chorus. The first variation is a transposition of the “Shake It” riff up a tone to F–G7/F (V–VI7). This moves the dominant of Bb, F, into the bass as well as ramping up the perceived tension of this theme. The harmony then moves to a figure in Eb then back to Dm7 (IV–iii). In the next eight bars, the “Shake It” riff appears a whole tone lower, over Eb–F7/Eb. The section ends with a backdoor-mediant turnaround resolving to Dm7.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <div id="osmd-BSCoda2"></div>
      </div>

      <p>On the second repetition of this section a vocal tag appears over the backdoor-mediant turnaround, ascending and descending a part of mixolydian mode (D–F–G–Ab–G–F etc.). After shifting between minor and major throughout the tune, the final vocal phrase lands somewhere in between the two, a bluesy sound that exploits the tension between the natural third and flattened seventh. This leads into a 50 second extended fade out.</p>
